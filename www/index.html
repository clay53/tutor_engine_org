        <h1>Focus on what you want</h1>
        <p>When you set target media, like a book, class, test, song, movie, or tv show, Tutor Engine will 
        make sure that you learn those skills first.</p>
        <img src="/assets/screenshot_of_target_media-2023-11-20.png"/>
        <h1>Get immersed in your learning</h1>
        <p>As you learn a language, the interface will transform to be in that language.</p>
        <h1>Minimize repitition</h1>
        <p>The flashcards test multiple skills at once and allow you to set custom intervals</p>

        <h1>Seamless collaboration</h1>
        <p>With the GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier) Authority Server (GAS), 
        new items (skills/media) can be identified without fear of conflicting with another user
        or data repository.</p>
        <h1>Learn online or offline</h1>
        <p>Once a copy of the app and repository is secured, non-online-multiplayer features of Tutor Engine can be used completely offline.</p>
        <h1>Topics already covered</h1>
        <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block">
            <li>Japanese Reading Comprehension</li>
            <ul>
                Set your target media to:
                <li><a href="https://bunpro.jp/lessons/1/reading_passages">N5 L1 Bunpro</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://bunpro.jp/lessons/2/reading_passages">N5 L2 Bunpro</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://jpbookstore.com/products/karameru">からめる</a> (WIP)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h1>Release Timeline</h1>
        <p>After 4 years of development, the app became usable on Tuesday, November 14th, 2023.</p>
        <p>The app is expected to go live with basic features for reading comprehension by December 25th, 2023.
        It will not be open source at this time.</p>
        <p>The app's method will hopefully undergo formal experiments to measure its effectiveness to be completed by the end of May 2024.</p>
        <p>A foundation will be created and funding will be secured to manage the development of the app summer of 2024.</p>
        <p>The foundation will work on creating a custom software license or identifying an existing one to restrict competing commericial derivatives. 
        The model is inspired by what is currently being done with <a href="https://grayjay.app/">Grayjay</a> (an incredible app btw).</p>
        <p>The source code for the app will become open source.
        Distribution platforms will only be able to make changes to the app that enhance/fix areas such as compatibility, security, and accessibility 
        (anything can be done internally: such as personal use or within a school, but all of the source code must be made available to users).</p>
